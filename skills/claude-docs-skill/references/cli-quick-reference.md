# Overview

> Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that reads your codebase, edits files, runs commands, and integrates with your development tools. Available in your terminal, IDE, desktop app, and browser.

Claude Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps you build features, fix bugs, and automate development tasks. It understands your entire codebase and can work across multiple files and tools to get things done.

## Get started

Choose your environment to get started. Most surfaces require a [Claude subscription](https://claude.com/pricing?utm_source=claude_code\&utm_medium=docs\&utm_content=overview_pricing) or [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) account. The Terminal CLI and VS Code also support [third-party providers](/en/third-party-integrations).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Terminal">
    The full-featured CLI for working with Claude Code directly in your terminal. Edit files, run commands, and manage your entire project from the command line.

    To install Claude Code, use one of the following methods:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Native Install (Recommended)">
        **macOS, Linux, WSL:**

        ```bash theme={null}
        curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
        ```

        **Windows PowerShell:**

        ```powershell theme={null}
        irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
        ```

        **Windows CMD:**

        ```batch theme={null}
        curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
        ```

        If you see `The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator`, you're in PowerShell, not CMD. If you see `'irm' is not recognized as an internal or external command`, you're in CMD, not PowerShell. Your prompt shows `PS C:\` when you're in PowerShell and `C:\` without the `PS` when you're in CMD.

        [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) is recommended on native Windows so Claude Code can use the Bash tool. If Git for Windows is not installed, Claude Code uses PowerShell as the shell tool instead. WSL setups do not need Git for Windows.

        <Info>
          Native installations automatically update in the background to keep you on the latest version.

# Quickstart

> Welcome to Claude Code!

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:

* A terminal or command prompt open
  * If you've never used the terminal before, check out the [terminal guide](/en/terminal-guide)
* A code project to work with
* A [Claude subscription](https://claude.com/pricing?utm_source=claude_code\&utm_medium=docs\&utm_content=quickstart_prereq) (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise), [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) account, or access through a [supported cloud provider](/en/third-party-integrations)

<Note>
  This guide covers the terminal CLI. Claude Code is also available on the [web](https://claude.ai/code), as a [desktop app](/en/desktop), in [VS Code](/en/vs-code) and [JetBrains IDEs](/en/jetbrains), in [Slack](/en/slack), and in CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](/en/github-actions) and [GitLab](/en/gitlab-ci-cd). See [all interfaces](/en/overview#use-claude-code-everywhere).

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

To install Claude Code, use one of the following methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Native Install (Recommended)">
    **macOS, Linux, WSL:**

    ```bash theme={null}
    curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
    ```

    **Windows PowerShell:**

    ```powershell theme={null}
    irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
    ```

    **Windows CMD:**

    ```batch theme={null}
    curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
    ```

    If you see `The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator`, you're in PowerShell, not CMD. If you see `'irm' is not recognized as an internal or external command`, you're in CMD, not PowerShell. Your prompt shows `PS C:\` when you're in PowerShell and `C:\` without the `PS` when you're in CMD.

    [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) is recommended on native Windows so Claude Code can use the Bash tool. If Git for Windows is not installed, Claude Code uses PowerShell as the shell tool instead. WSL setups do not need Git for Windows.

# Common workflows

> Step-by-step guides for exploring codebases, fixing bugs, refactoring, testing, and other everyday tasks with Claude Code.

This page collects short recipes for everyday development. For higher-level guidance on prompting and context management, see [Best practices](/en/best-practices).

This page covers:

* [Prompt recipes](#prompt-recipes) for exploring code, fixing bugs, refactoring, testing, PRs, and documentation
* [Resume previous conversations](#resume-previous-conversations) so a task can span multiple sittings
* [Run parallel sessions with worktrees](#run-parallel-sessions-with-worktrees) so concurrent edits don't collide
* [Plan before editing](#plan-before-editing) to review changes before they touch disk
* [Delegate research to subagents](#delegate-research-to-subagents) to keep your main context clean
* [Pipe Claude into scripts](#pipe-claude-into-scripts) for CI and batch processing

## Prompt recipes

These are prompt patterns for everyday tasks like exploring unfamiliar code, debugging, refactoring, writing tests, and creating PRs. Each works in any Claude Code surface; adapt the wording to your project.

# Best practices for Claude Code

> Tips and patterns for getting the most out of Claude Code, from configuring your environment to scaling across parallel sessions.

Claude Code is an agentic coding environment. Unlike a chatbot that answers questions and waits, Claude Code can read your files, run commands, make changes, and autonomously work through problems while you watch, redirect, or step away entirely.

This changes how you work. Instead of writing code yourself and asking Claude to review it, you describe what you want and Claude figures out how to build it. Claude explores, plans, and implements.

But this autonomy still comes with a learning curve. Claude works within certain constraints you need to understand.

This guide covers patterns that have proven effective across Anthropic's internal teams and for engineers using Claude Code across various codebases, languages, and environments. For how the agentic loop works under the hood, see [How Claude Code works](/en/how-claude-code-works).

***

Most best practices are based on one constraint: Claude's context window fills up fast, and performance degrades as it fills.

Claude's context window holds your entire conversation, including every message, every file Claude reads, and every command output. However, this can fill up fast. A single debugging session or codebase exploration might generate and consume tens of thousands of tokens.

This matters since LLM performance degrades as context fills. When the context window is getting full, Claude may start "forgetting" earlier instructions or making more mistakes. The context window is the most important resource to manage. To see how a session fills up in practice, [watch an interactive walkthrough](/en/context-window) of what loads at startup and what each file read costs. Track context usage continuously with a [custom status line](/en/statusline), and see [Reduce token usage](/en/costs#reduce-token-usage) for strategies on reducing token usage.

***

## Give Claude a way to verify its work

<Tip>
  Include tests, screenshots, or expected outputs so Claude can check itself. This is the single highest-leverage thing you can do.
</Tip>

Claude performs dramatically better when it can verify its own work, like run tests, compare screenshots, and validate outputs.

### Extend Claude Code

# Extend Claude Code

> Understand when to use CLAUDE.md, Skills, subagents, hooks, MCP, and plugins.

Claude Code combines a model that reasons about your code with [built-in tools](/en/how-claude-code-works#tools) for file operations, search, execution, and web access. The built-in tools cover most coding tasks. This guide covers the extension layer: features you add to customize what Claude knows, connect it to external services, and automate workflows.

<Note>
  For how the core agentic loop works, see [How Claude Code works](/en/how-claude-code-works).
</Note>

**New to Claude Code?** Start with [CLAUDE.md](/en/memory) for project conventions, then add other extensions [as specific triggers come up](#build-your-setup-over-time).

## Overview

Extensions plug into different parts of the agentic loop:

* **[CLAUDE.md](/en/memory)** adds persistent context Claude sees every session
* **[Skills](/en/skills)** add reusable knowledge and invocable workflows
* **[Code intelligence](/en/tools-reference#lsp-tool-behavior)** connects Claude to a language server for symbol-level navigation and live type errors
* **[MCP](/en/mcp)** connects Claude to external services and tools
* **[Subagents](/en/sub-agents)** run their own loops in isolated context, returning summaries
* **[Agent teams](/en/agent-teams)** coordinate multiple independent sessions with shared tasks and peer-to-peer messaging
* **[Hooks](/en/hooks-guide)** fire on lifecycle events and can run a script, HTTP request, prompt, or subagent
* **[Plugins](/en/plugins)** and **[marketplaces](/en/plugin-marketplaces)** package and distribute these features

[Skills](/en/skills) are the most flexible extension. A skill is a markdown file containing knowledge, workflows, or instructions. You can invoke skills with a command like `/deploy`, or Claude can load them automatically when relevant. Skills can run in your current conversation or in an isolated context via subagents.

## Match features to your goal

Features range from always-on context that Claude sees every session, to on-demand capabilities you or Claude can invoke, to background automation that runs on specific events. The table below shows what's available and when each one makes sense.

# How Claude Code works

> Understand the agentic loop, built-in tools, and how Claude Code interacts with your project.

Claude Code is an agentic assistant that runs in your terminal. While it excels at coding, it can help with anything you can do from the command line: writing docs, running builds, searching files, researching topics, and more.

This guide covers the core architecture, built-in capabilities, and [tips for working effectively](#work-effectively-with-claude-code). For step-by-step walkthroughs, see [Common workflows](/en/common-workflows). For extensibility features like skills, MCP, and hooks, see [Extend Claude Code](/en/features-overview).

## The agentic loop

When you give Claude a task, it works through three phases: **gather context**, **take action**, and **verify results**. These phases blend together. Claude uses tools throughout, whether searching files to understand your code, editing to make changes, or running tests to check its work.

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/claude-code/c5r9_6tjPMzFdDDT/images/agentic-loop.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=c5r9_6tjPMzFdDDT&q=85&s=5f1827dec8539f38adee90ead3a85a38" alt="The agentic loop: Your prompt leads to Claude gathering context, taking action, verifying results, and repeating until task complete. You can interrupt at any point." width="720" height="280" data-path="images/agentic-loop.svg" />

The loop adapts to what you ask. A question about your codebase might only need context gathering. A bug fix cycles through all three phases repeatedly. A refactor might involve extensive verification. Claude decides what each step requires based on what it learned from the previous step, chaining dozens of actions together and course-correcting along the way.

You're part of this loop too. You can interrupt at any point to steer Claude in a different direction, provide additional context, or ask it to try a different approach. Claude works autonomously but stays responsive to your input.

The agentic loop is powered by two components: [models](#models) that reason and [tools](#tools) that act. Claude Code serves as the **agentic harness** around Claude: it provides the tools, context management, and execution environment that turn a language model into a capable coding agent.

### Models

### Create plugins

# Create plugins

> Create custom plugins to extend Claude Code with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers.

Plugins let you extend Claude Code with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams. This guide covers creating your own plugins with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers.

Looking to install existing plugins? See [Discover and install plugins](/en/discover-plugins). For complete technical specifications, see [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference).

## When to use plugins vs standalone configuration

Claude Code supports two ways to add custom skills, agents, and hooks:

| Approach                                                    | Skill names          | Best for                                                                                        |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standalone** (`.claude/` directory)                       | `/hello`             | Personal workflows, project-specific customizations, quick experiments                          |
| **Plugins** (directories with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) | `/plugin-name:hello` | Sharing with teammates, distributing to community, versioned releases, reusable across projects |

**Use standalone configuration when**:

* You're customizing Claude Code for a single project
* The configuration is personal and doesn't need to be shared
* You're experimenting with skills or hooks before packaging them
* You want short skill names like `/hello` or `/deploy`

**Use plugins when**:

* You want to share functionality with your team or community
* You need the same skills/agents across multiple projects
* You want version control and easy updates for your extensions
* You're distributing through a marketplace
* You're okay with namespaced skills like `/my-plugin:hello` (namespacing prevents conflicts between plugins)

<Tip>
  Start with standalone configuration in `.claude/` for quick iteration, then [convert to a plugin](#convert-existing-configurations-to-plugins) when you're ready to share.
</Tip>

### Extend Claude with skills
*Source: /skills.md*

> ## Documentation Index

> Use this file to discover all available pages before exploring further.

# Extend Claude with skills

> Create, manage, and share skills to extend Claude's capabilities in Claude Code. Includes custom commands and bundled skills.

Skills extend what Claude can do. Create a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, and Claude adds it to its toolkit. Claude uses skills when relevant, or you can invoke one directly with `/skill-name`.

Create a skill when you keep pasting the same instructions, checklist, or multi-step procedure into chat, or when a section of CLAUDE.md has grown into a procedure rather than a fact. Unlike CLAUDE.md content, a skill's body loads only when it's used, so long reference material costs almost nothing until you need it.

<Note>
  For built-in commands like `/help` and `/compact`, and bundled skills like `/debug` and `/simplify`, see the [commands reference](/en/commands).

  **Custom commands have been merged into skills.** A file at `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and a skill at `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` both create `/deploy` and work the same way. Your existing `.claude/commands/` files keep working. Skills add optional features: a directory for supporting files, frontmatter to [control whether you or Claude invokes them](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), and the ability for Claude to load them automatically when relevant.
</Note>

Claude Code skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, which works across multiple AI tools. Claude Code extends the standard with additional features like [invocation control](#control-who-invokes-a-skill), [subagent execution](#run-skills-in-a-subagent), and [dynamic context injection](#inject-dynamic-context).

## Bundled skills

Claude Code includes a set of bundled skills that are available in every session, including `/simplify`, `/batch`, `/debug`, `/loop`, and `/claude-api`. Unlike most built-in commands, which execute fixed logic directly, bundled skills are prompt-based: they give Claude detailed instructions and let it orchestrate the work using its tools. You invoke them the same way as any other skill, by typing `/` followed by the skill name.

Bundled skills are listed alongside built-in commands in the [commands reference](/en/commands), marked **Skill** in the Purpose column.

### Automate workflows with hooks
*Source: /hooks-guide.md*

> ## Documentation Index

> Use this file to discover all available pages before exploring further.

# Automate workflows with hooks

> Run shell commands automatically when Claude Code edits files, finishes tasks, or needs input. Format code, send notifications, validate commands, and enforce project rules.

Hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at specific points in Claude Code's lifecycle. They provide deterministic control over Claude Code's behavior, ensuring certain actions always happen rather than relying on the LLM to choose to run them. Use hooks to enforce project rules, automate repetitive tasks, and integrate Claude Code with your existing tools.

For decisions that require judgment rather than deterministic rules, you can also use [prompt-based hooks](#prompt-based-hooks) or [agent-based hooks](#agent-based-hooks) that use a Claude model to evaluate conditions.

For other ways to extend Claude Code, see [skills](/en/skills) for giving Claude additional instructions and executable commands, [subagents](/en/sub-agents) for running tasks in isolated contexts, and [plugins](/en/plugins) for packaging extensions to share across projects.

<Tip>
  This guide covers common use cases and how to get started. For full event schemas, JSON input/output formats, and advanced features like async hooks and MCP tool hooks, see the [Hooks reference](/en/hooks).
</Tip>

## Set up your first hook

To create a hook, add a `hooks` block to a [settings file](#configure-hook-location). This walkthrough creates a desktop notification hook, so you get alerted whenever Claude is waiting for your input instead of watching the terminal.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the hook to your settings">
    Open `~/.claude/settings.json` and add a `Notification` hook. The example below uses `osascript` for macOS; see [Get notified when Claude needs input](#get-notified-when-claude-needs-input) for Linux and Windows commands.

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "hooks": {
        "Notification": [
          {
            "matcher": "",
            "hooks": [
              {
                "type": "command",
                "command": "osascript -e 'display notification \"Claude Code needs your attention\" with title \"Claude Code\"'"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

### Create custom subagents
*Source: /sub-agents.md*

> ## Documentation Index

> Use this file to discover all available pages before exploring further.

# Create custom subagents

> Create and use specialized AI subagents in Claude Code for task-specific workflows and improved context management.

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Use one when a side task would flood your main conversation with search results, logs, or file contents you won't reference again: the subagent does that work in its own context and returns only the summary. Define a custom subagent when you keep spawning the same kind of worker with the same instructions.

Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions. When Claude encounters a task that matches a subagent's description, it delegates to that subagent, which works independently and returns results. To see the context savings in practice, the [context window visualization](/en/context-window) walks through a session where a subagent handles research in its own separate window.

<Note>
  Subagents work within a single session. To run many independent sessions in parallel and monitor them from one place, see [background agents](/en/agent-view). For sessions that communicate with each other, see [agent teams](/en/agent-teams).
</Note>

Subagents help you:

* **Preserve context** by keeping exploration and implementation out of your main conversation
* **Enforce constraints** by limiting which tools a subagent can use
* **Reuse configurations** across projects with user-level subagents
* **Specialize behavior** with focused system prompts for specific domains
* **Control costs** by routing tasks to faster, cheaper models like Haiku

Claude uses each subagent's description to decide when to delegate tasks. When you create a subagent, write a clear description so Claude knows when to use it.

Claude Code includes several built-in subagents like **Explore**, **Plan**, and **general-purpose**. You can also create custom subagents to handle specific tasks. This page covers:

* [Built-in subagents](#built-in-subagents)
* [How to create your own](#quickstart-create-your-first-subagent)
* [Full configuration options](#configure-subagents)
* [Patterns for working with subagents](#work-with-subagents)
* [Forked subagents](#fork-the-current-conversation)
* [Example subagents](#example-subagents)
